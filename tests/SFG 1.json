    "answer": 3,

    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: (d)</b><br><br>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, in his historic concluding speech to the Constituent Assembly on 25th November 1949, emphasized that political democracy cannot last unless it rests on the foundation of social democracy. He defined social democracy as a way of life, which recognizes liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life. These principles, he asserted, “are not to be treated as separate items in a trinity.” He explained that liberty cannot be divorced from equality, equality cannot be divorced from liberty, and nor can liberty and equality be divorced from fraternity. Divorcing one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy."
