    "question": "<b>Topic: IS-LM Model</b><br>In the IS-LM framework, a 'Liquidity Trap' occurs when the LM curve is:",
    "options": ["Vertical", "Horizontal", "Upward Sloping", "Downward Sloping"],
    "answer": 1,
    "marks": 1,
    "section": "Economics",
    "topic": "IS-LM",
    "explanation": "In a Liquidity Trap, interest rates are so low that people prefer holding cash. The demand for money becomes infinitely elastic, making the LM curve **Horizontal** (flat). Monetary policy is ineffective here."
