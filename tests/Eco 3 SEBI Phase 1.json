    "question": "In the context of the IS-LM model, what is the effect of an increase in Government Spending (G) on the IS curve and the equilibrium interest rate, assuming the LM curve is upward sloping?",
    "options": [
      "IS curve shifts to the left; Interest rate decreases",
      "IS curve shifts to the right; Interest rate increases",
      "IS curve shifts to the right; Interest rate decreases",
      "LM curve shifts to the right; Interest rate increases",
      "No change in IS curve; Interest rate remains constant"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "An increase in Government Spending (fiscal expansion) shifts the IS curve to the **right**. As aggregate demand rises, demand for money increases, pushing the interest rate **up** (assuming money supply is constant)."
